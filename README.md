## Sample Databases for MongoDB ##

# What it is

Sample databases to import to MongoDB.


## Windows 10
* Just a simple data dump from SQL's Northwind database to a CSV
* CSV (northwind.csv) turned into multiple CSVs
* CSVs imported into Mongo (mongo-import.bat)


# Thanks
Thanks to [@shayden](https://github.com/shayden) for the csv dump. Buyer beware, caveat emptor, carthago delenda est et al
